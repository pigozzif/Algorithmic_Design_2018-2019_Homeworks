# Homework 2 - Chain Matrix Multiplication Problem
## Content
The `matrix_multiplication.c` file contains an implementation of the algorithm for finding the optimal parenthetization as explained in class, together with a main function containing all the tests to be done. The `matrix.c` script contains common matrix routines, whose signature is then reported in the `matrix.h` header file.

## Compilation
Type `make` and an executable named `chain_test.x` will be produced.
