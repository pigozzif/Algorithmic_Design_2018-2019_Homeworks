# Homework 1 - Strassen Algorithm for Matrix Multiplication
## Content
This folder contains the same material developed during the live implementation held in class at the beginning of the semester. In addition, you can find the `improved_strassen.c` file which contains two improved versions of the algorithm. The `main.c` file is dedicated to the tests to be run.

## Compilation
Type `make` and an executable named `strassen_test.x` will be produced.

## Timings
All the timings have been taken in seconds.
