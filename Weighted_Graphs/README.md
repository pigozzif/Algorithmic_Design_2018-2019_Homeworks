# Homework 6 - Weighted Graphs
## Content
The `graph_utilities.h` header file contains different data structures to be used to benchmark the performance of Dijkstra's algorithm, whose implementation is instead to be found in the `dijkstra.cc` source file, together with a main function for the tests.

## Compilation
Type `make` and an executable named `dijkstra.x` will be generated.

## Timings
Timings have been taken in nanoseconds.
