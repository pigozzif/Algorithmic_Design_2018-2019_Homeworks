# Homework 3 - Retrieving Data and Sorting
## Content
The folder is organized as follows:
 - Three source files have been written, separately, for comparison sorts, linear-time sorting algorithms, and the select algorithm;
 - Each source file has a `main` function with all the related tests;
 - The header file `sort_utils.h` contains common routines for the assignments of this homework, together with the implementation of the `insertion_sort` algorithm (whose tests are to be found in the `comparison_sort.cc` file).
 
 ## Compilation
 Type `make` and three executables will be produced: `comparison_sort.x`, `linear.x`, `select.x`.
 
 ## Timings
 All the timings of this homework have been taken in milliseconds.
