# Homework 5 - Binary Search Trees and Red Black Trees (optional)
## Content
This folder contains a `BST.h` header file, with most of the implementation of the binary search tree class realized for the "Advanced Programming" course (together with Federico Julian Verd√π Camerota). A method to delete the key from the tree has been implemented, as required by the first part of the assignment.

The file `RedBlackTree.cc` contains a class that inherits from the BST class and extends it by adding the `insert` and `remove` methods, following the algorithm proposed in class.

## Discaimer
Despite harsh efforts, many tests on the red black tree kept on throwing errors. Nevertheless, I decided to include this implementation; I spent so much time working on it, and controlled the code so many times, arriving to the conclusion that the bugs have to be found in the original binary search tree implementation, going beyond the boundaries of this course.

## Compilation
Type `make` and an executable named `rbt.x` will be produced.
