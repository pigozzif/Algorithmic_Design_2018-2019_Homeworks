# Homework 5 - Binary Search Trees and Red Black Trees (optional)
## Content
This folder contains a `BST.h` header file, with most of the implementation of the binary search tree class realized for the "Advanced Programming" course (together with Federico Julian Verd√π Camerota). A method to delete the key from the tree has been implemented, as required by the first part of the assignment.

The file `RedBlackTree.cc` contains a class that inherits from the BST class and extends it by adding the insertion method, following the algorithm proposed in class. Unfortunately, I did complete the `remove` method on time, and I feel deeply sorry for this.

## Discaimer
Despite harsh efforts, many tests on the red black tree kept on throwing errors. Nevertheless, I decided to include this implementation; according to me, the bugs have to be found in the original binary search tree implementation, going beyond the boundaries of this course.

## Compilation
Type `make` and an executable named `rbt.x` will be produced.
